            <h3>Professional Summary</h3>
            <p>
                I am a multidisciplinary engineer with 7 years of experience working at the intersection of software
                development, product management, and design.
                For over 5 years I worked at a startup called Level Ex where I developed medical video games and
                interactive
                experiences with the goal of democratizing medical training and drive behavior change.
                Serving as a translational subject matter expert in biomedical topics I defined experiences that allowed
                users
                to challenge and further develop their existing mental models around complex and ambiguous medical
                topics.
                My work spans multiple apps in several medical specialties and has even expanded into space medicine.
                In the last 2 years, I decided to teach myself various programming languages and pursue my deep interest
                in
                software development.
                Five months ago I decided to completely invest in myself and take a break from work so I can focus on
                learning
                full time (and indulge in some much needed travel)! Check out my projects:
